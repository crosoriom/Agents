# Project: "Concierge" - The n8n Personal Productivity Assistant

This project demonstrates the power of the **n8n low-code automation platform** to create a sophisticated, multi-purpose AI assistant. "Concierge" acts as a personal productivity aide, accessed through the simple and ubiquitous interface of **WhatsApp**.

The primary goal of this project is to showcase how a visual workflow builder can be used to seamlessly orchestrate a variety of APIs and generative AI models, resulting in a valuable and interactive user experience with minimal code.

## Core Features & User Interactions

The agent is event-driven, triggered by specific commands sent to its WhatsApp number:

*   **/briefing**: Delivers a personalized "Daily Briefing." It fetches and summarizes:
    *   Today's calendar events from **Google Calendar**.
    *   The current weather forecast from **OpenWeatherMap**.
    *   Top headlines from **NewsAPI**.
    *   The final output is a cohesive summary generated by an **LLM (Gemini/OpenAI)**.

*   **/addtask `[Your task]`**: Adds a task to a user's **Todoist** project, providing instant productivity integration.
    *   *Example: `/addtask Buy groceries for the week`*

*   **/spark `[Your idea]`**: Acts as a creative co-pilot. It takes a concept and uses generative AI to:
    1.  Brainstorm a more detailed idea using an **LLM**.
    *   *Example: `/spark A logo for a futuristic coffee shop`*

*   **/help**: Displays a list of available commands and their usage.

## Setup and Implementation Guide

To replicate this project, you will need to import the workflow into your own n8n instance and configure the credentials.

### 1. Prerequisites (Crucial First Step)

Before you begin, you must have accounts and API keys for the following services:

*   **n8n:** A running instance (n8n Cloud or self-hosted).
*   **Meta for Developers:** A configured WhatsApp Business App with a phone number and a permanent access token.
*   **Google Cloud:** OAuth2 credentials to permit n8n to access Google Calendar.
*   **LLM Provider:** An API key for Google Gemini (or OpenAI).
*   **Todoist:** An API key from your Todoist account settings.
*   **NewsAPI:** A free API key.
*   **OpenWeatherMap:** A free API key.

### 2. Import the n8n Workflow

The JSON definition for this entire workflow should be stored in this directory.

1.  Create a new, blank workflow in your n8n instance.
2.  Open the `workflow.json` file from this repository.
3.  Copy the entire JSON content.
4.  In n8n, click on the canvas and paste the code (Ctrl+V or Cmd+V). The entire "Concierge" workflow will appear.

### 3. Connect Your Credentials

After importing, the nodes will have broken credentials. You must link them to your own.

1.  In the left sidebar of your n8n instance, go to **Credentials** and add a new credential for each of the services listed in the prerequisites.
2.  Go through the imported workflow, node by node:
    *   Click on the **WhatsApp Trigger** node and select your WhatsApp credential from the dropdown.
    *   Click on the **Google Calendar** node and select your Google OAuth2 credential.
    *   Click on the **Gemini (LLM)** node and select your Google Vertex AI credential.
    *   Repeat this process for every node that requires authentication (Todoist, Stability AI, etc.).

## Example Usage

Interacting with the agent is simple and intuitive.

**User sends to WhatsApp:**
> /briefing

**Concierge replies:**
> *Good morning!* ☀️
>
> It's currently *18°C and clear skies* in your area.
>
> Here’s what’s on your schedule today:
> • *11:00 AM - 11:30 AM:* Project Titan Sync
> • *3:00 PM - 4:00 PM:* Q3 Planning Session
>
> Here are today's top headlines:
> 1. _New AI Developments Unveiled at Tech Conference_
> 2. _Global Markets Respond to Economic Data_
>
> Your thought for the day:
> _"Success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts."_

## Demonstrated Academic Concepts

This project serves as a practical demonstration of several key concepts in modern software and AI development:

*   **Low-Code AI Integration:** Showcasing how complex AI-powered workflows can be built with minimal code, focusing on logic over syntax.
*   **API Orchestration:** The art of seamlessly connecting and passing data between multiple, independent web services.
*   **Event-Driven Architecture:** Building a reactive system that is triggered by external events (a WhatsApp message).
*   **Multi-Modal AI:** Combining language models (for text) and diffusion models (for images) in a single workflow to provide richer, more engaging user experiences.
*   **ChatOps:** Using a conversational interface as a command-and-control center for powerful backend processes.
