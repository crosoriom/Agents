This document outlines the architecture and methodology for developing an AI agent capable of exploring various online shops to identify the best product choices based on quality and price. The agent leverages a hybrid communication strategy, combining traditional web scraping with the emerging Model Context Protocol (MCP) and direct API access for enhanced robustness and adaptability.The agent's operation is structured into two distinct phases: a First Use (Configuration/Setup) Phase for building its knowledge base of stores, and Posterior Uses (User Request) Phase for fulfilling specific product search queries.

## 1. Agent Architecture
The AI Shopping Agent is designed with modular components to handle perception, knowledge representation, reasoning, and user interaction. A key differentiator is the Shop Communication Orchestrator, which intelligently routes data acquisition requests based on a shop's communication capabilities and a defined priority.

## 2. Key Components and Functionality

### 2.1. Shop Communication Orchestrator
This central component acts as the traffic controller for data acquisition. It maintains a Shop Registry detailing each known shop, including whether it supports MCP, API, or requires web scraping, its specific configuration (MCP endpoint, API endpoint, or web scraping parameters), and its geographical scope (local, national, international). During the Posterior Uses Phase, it prioritizes access methods in the following order: MCP > APIs > Web Scraping.

### 2.2. Store Discovery & Database Building (First Use Phase)
This is a crucial initial step. Upon the agent's first use or configuration, it performs the following:

* **User Location Access**: The agent obtains the user's current geographical location (simulated for this code, but in a real application, this would involve location APIs or user input).
* **Local Store Identification**: It identifies and adds all possible relevant local stores within the user's immediate vicinity to the Shop Registry.
* **National Store Identification**: It identifies and adds a curated list of approximately 10 prominent national stores to the Shop Registry.
* **International Store Identification**: It identifies and adds a curated list of approximately 10 international stores known for shipping to the user's location to the Shop Registry.
* **Access Method Recording**: For each discovered store, the registry records the preferred method for subsequent access. This will now prioritize MCP first, then APIs, and finally web scraping if neither of the former is available or successful. This builds the foundational Shop Registry within the Knowledge Base.

### 2.3. MCP Client Module
This module is responsible for interacting with shops that have implemented an MCP Server.

* **MCP Protocol Implementation**: It understands and conforms to the MCP specification for sending requests and parsing responses (e.g., JSON-RPC over HTTP/2).
* **Tool Invocation**: It leverages standardized MCP tools exposed by the shop's server (e.g., search_product, get_product_details, get_customer_reviews, check_availability).
* **Robustness**: Includes mechanisms for error handling, retries, timeouts, and managing authentication/authorization required by MCP servers.

### 2.4. API Client Module (New Component)
This new module handles direct communication with shops that provide traditional RESTful or GraphQL APIs.

* **API Integration**: It sends HTTP requests to specific API endpoints (e.g., /products/search, /products/{id}) and parses JSON/XML responses.
* **Authentication**: Manages API keys, tokens, or OAuth flows as required by different shop APIs.
* **Error Handling**: Implements robust error handling for API-specific responses (e.g., rate limits, invalid requests, server errors) and retries.

### 2.5. Web Scraping Module
This module handles data acquisition from shops that do not yet support MCP or a public API, or if previous methods fail.

* **Shop-Specific Logic**: Contains custom scraping scripts tailored to the HTML structure of individual websites (utilizing libraries like requests, BeautifulSoup, and Selenium for dynamic content).
* **Anti-Scraping Evasion**: Incorporates techniques such as IP address rotation, user-agent spoofing, and headless browser emulation to bypass common anti-bot measures.
* **Maintenance**: While robust, this module will require periodic updates as website structures change, necessitating ongoing maintenance.
* **Error Reporting**: Logs and reports specific scraping failures for debugging and maintenance.

### 2.6. Data Processing & Normalization Layer
This critical layer ensures data consistency regardless of its origin (MCP, API, or web scraping).

* **Unified Schema**: All incoming product data is mapped and transformed into a standardized internal product schema (e.g., product_id, product_name, shop_name, price, currency, availability, product_url, quality_score, raw_reviews).
* **Parsing and Cleaning**: Extracts relevant information from raw data, handles data inconsistencies, and cleans textual data.
* **Quality Metric Extraction**: This is where the "AI" truly shines beyond data collection. It applies Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques (e.g., sentiment analysis, aspect-based sentiment analysis) to customer reviews (whether obtained via MCP, API, or scraping) and extracts product specifications. These are then used to calculate a normalized quality_score for each product.
* **Error Handling**: Detects and manages missing or malformed data points during the transformation process.

### 2.7. Knowledge Base (Database)
A central repository (e.g., SQL or NoSQL database) for all product data collected. It stores information in the unified product schema, ensuring that the downstream decision-making logic always operates on a consistent and well-structured dataset, regardless of the data source. Crucially, in this updated architecture, it also stores the Shop Registry built during the First Use Phase, now including API access details.

### 2.8. Decision-Making & User Interface (Posterior Uses Phase)
* **Decision-Making**: This component receives the normalized product data from the Knowledge Base. It implements multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) algorithms (e.g., Weighted Sum Model) to evaluate products based on predefined or user-configurable weights for price and quality. It then ranks the products to determine the "best choice."
* **User Interface**: Presents the recommended products to the user in a clear, digestible format, often including filtering, sorting, and comparison options.

## 3. Benefits of the Hybrid Approach
This blended strategy offers significant advantages:
* **Maximum Coverage**: The agent can interact with a broad spectrum of online shops, regardless of their API maturity or MCP adoption.
* **Future-Proofing**: It's prepared for the increasing adoption of MCP and API standards while remaining functional in environments where they are not yet prevalent.
* **Enhanced Reliability**: The layered fallback mechanism (MCP > API > Web Scraping) ensures that product discovery continues even if a preferred method fails for a specific shop.
* **Improved Efficiency**: When MCP or APIs are available, they provide faster, more reliable, and potentially richer data streams compared to traditional scraping.
* **Consistent Data**: The crucial normalization layer guarantees that all collected data, regardless of its source, conforms to a unified schema for consistent analysis.
* **Optimized Performance (Two-Phase)**: By pre-building the shop database, subsequent user requests are faster as the agent doesn't need to re-discover shops each time. It directly queries the known sources.

This hybrid model makes the AI shopping agent not just powerful in its search capabilities but also highly resilient and adaptable to the evolving landscape of digital commerce.
